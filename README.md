# SpikeAnal
 This MATLAB script is used to read Spike mutation .fasta files from GIASID and quantify mutations at each site, with focus on N- and O-linked
 glycosylation site mutations. But, of couse, it can be used for other site mutation quantitation also<br/>
 Input: .txt/.fasta file downloaded from GISAID (not provided since this requires permission from GISAID, and distribution is restricted)<br/>
 Output: mutation freq. across the length of Spike protein at each a. acid position
