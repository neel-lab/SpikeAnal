# SpikeAnal
 This MATLAB script is used to read Spike .fasta files from GIASID.org, and quantify mutations at each of the protein amino acid sites, with focus on N- and O-linked
 glycosylation site mutations. <br/>
 <br/>
 Input: .txt/.fasta file downloaded from GISAID.org (not provided since this requires permission from GISAID, and distribution is restricted)<br/>
 <br/>
 Output: mutation freq. across the length of Spike protein at each a.acid position
